Once you have clarity over what kind of new decor you want, you would be able to that execute your plan perfectly. Contemplate if you want spaciousness, compactness, or complete refurbish of ambiance and proceed accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focal point Decide for a new spotlight in your living room to give it a new look. If your sofa has been the focal point so far, change it to a striking wall panel, a unique artifact, a mini artificial landscape or an imposing showcase. The idea is to shift the focal point so that rest of the furnishings can be revamped to get a refreshing ambiance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repositioning of furniture Repositioning of furniture can bring a whole deal of new look to your living room. Change the directions of side tables; alter the wall faced by sofas; replace chairs with couches or vice versa and get the desired decor. However, do not meddle with the practicality of the furniture positions else someone would keep on tripping every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mixing and matching Revamp your living room by mixing and matching various furnishings. For example,interlace your sofa set with matching settee; amalgamate some bamboo furniture as a complimentary décor; display an ethnic artifact alongside a swanky lampshade. Such innovative combination will infuse a sense of novelty and make for an interesting décor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Visual charisma Establish a visual charisma in your living room with some inherent aesthetic sense that would reflect you and your home’s character. Place and replace the furnishings in your living room until you get a sense of entirety in the ambiance with a perfect balance between formality and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;"></asp:Label>

Then consider a makeover of your sofa- give your old couch a new look! Are you asking how?Here are some ways to make your old sofa look new.Use a slipcover over sofaIf your sofa looks beaten up or if the print doesn’t match with your décor, you can place a slip cover over your sofa. This is the easiest way to freshen up your old couch. If possible, go for a custom made slipcover that fits tight.If not, you’ll get slipcovers in many sizes and styles and it will not be a problem to find one that fits seamlessly to your sofa.If you don’t find one that tightly fits your sofa, take a wooden spatula and push the fabric deep into sofa’s crevices. If yours is a leather couch, and the slipcover slides over, use nonslip carpet padding on the seat cushion to give a tout look to the sofa.Make your couch colourfully textured.If your sofa isn’t all worn out but has become boring, you can bring back the interest element rather quickly by adding pops of colours over it. Use new cushion covers of larger size or mixed sizes. New cushion covers are cheaper options. Use ruffled cushion covers to introduce texture. You may even use pillow shams to be different and make your sofa a little distinctive.Decorate sofa with beautiful sofa throws Placing a beautiful sofa throw on the back of a sofa will add a new dimension to your couch and give it an instant life! Crochet sofa throws are really nice. However, select the throws as per your décor style. You may select anything from among fur throws, satin throws, contemporary sofa throws with geometrical or abstract designs, anything that goes with your living room décor.Sometimes it only takes to plump up your cushions to bring back that crispy look to your old sofa. Some other times it needs to change the fabric that you may do with the help of throws and slipcovers. Little accessories can go a long way to make your old sofa look new.&lt;/p&gt;"></asp:Label>

                    Text="&lt;p&gt;Of all the rooms in your home, your bed room is obviously the most important one. It is more than a room where you sleep for eight hours a day. It is your personal space which you do not like to share with anyone else. Your bedroom perhaps reflects your personality most accurately. It should be a room where you would like to spend your time after a long day’s work. It should reflect your preference and not your designer’s.You should use the colors and furnishing wisely to make the room cheerful enough.  Choosing the right kind of fabrics is also very important. The room should be decorated in such a way that one would feel pleased at the idea of spending time there. The different components of the furnishing, the colors and the fabrics used should create a beautiful but much required harmony.The most important thing to consider while decorating your bedroom is choose the right kind of furniture. The right kind of furniture will make any bedroom look like your personal haven. The list of furniture will include the bed, wardrobes, the chest of drawers, the bedside tables, the tables and chairs, the dressing table etc.The type obviously depends on a number of things like your taste and preference, budget, requirements and usage, the theme of the room and most importantly the room itself.While buying furniture for your home you need to be practical. Buy furniture which suits your bed room and at the same time reflects your personality.If you have a small bed room you need not worry much about it. Today a wide range of furniture is available that will make your small bed room look bigger and better.You just need some time and patience to pick the right kind of furniture for your bed room. In a small bed room you need to ensure that the entire wall space is properly used. Wardrobes set in the wall or nightstands hung from the wall look great and save up a lot of space too.For small spaces, opt for rectilinear furniture and not curved ones. This is because the latter tend to take up much more space compared to rectilinear ones. The bed is definitely the center of attraction in a bed room. Choose a bed that suits your room and that does not make your room look cramped.If you require a television set in your room go for a flat screen one. It can be mounted up on the wall or placed on the dresser without any fuss. A skirted table beside the bed is the ideal way to store the magazines and books that you read.The bedside table can be kept free by hanging the reading lights on the wall. Mirrors can be used effectively to create the illusion of a much bigger bed room. Get a mirror and keep it somewhere where it reflects a window. Go for bed room units in pale wood or timbre.You should pick units which are tall and simple in design. Build shelves of varying patterns and colors on the walls to free up floor space. Lighting also plays an important role. Buy hanging lights and focus the maximum light on the bed itself.&lt;/p&gt;"></asp:Label>
